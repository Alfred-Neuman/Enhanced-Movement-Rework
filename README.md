#### Requirements

- [CBA_A3](https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3)
- [Enhanced Movment](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=333310405)

### Info

This is a rewrite of BadBenson's "Enhanced Movement."
Disables all functions in EM to solely use the animations with new lightweight scripts.

Default action key is 'V' (configurable via CBA Keybinding).
When pressed, script detects whether to climb or drop. If no advanced movements are available, then the vanilla vault function occurs.

The mod is still under development, with many features yet to be implemented and bugs still to be found.
Feel free to submit issues or suggest any new features via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/SceptreOfficial/Enhanced-Movement-Rework/issues).

**Known Issues:**
- Camera may be glitchy sometimes
- Climbing on some objects (specifically thin ones like walls) can cause the player to float or take damage. This issue is with the object, not the mod.
