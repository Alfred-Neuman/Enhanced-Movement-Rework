#### Requirements

- [CBA_A3](https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3)
- [Enhanced Movment](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=333310405)

### Info

This is a rewrite of BadBenson's "Enhanced Movement."
Disables all functions in EM to solely use the animations with new lightweight scripts. The goal of the mod is to simplify the functions, expand functionality, and get rid of any issues EM had. The mod will also be open source, so any contributions are welcome.

Default action key is 'Shift+V' (configurable via CBA keybinding)
Climbing will occur automatically when looking at a valid obstacle. Dropping will occur when looking down from a tall edge. Jumping will occur if other action conditions aren't met.

'Climb/Drop only' and 'Jump only' keybinds are also available via CBA keybinding.

Check the addon options for more customization.

The mod is still under development, with many features yet to be implemented and bugs still to be found.
Feel free to submit issues or suggest any new features via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/SceptreOfficial/Enhanced-Movement-Rework/issues).

**Known Issues:**
- Camera may be glitchy sometimes
- Climbing on some objects (specifically thin ones like walls) can cause the player to float or take damage. This issue is with the object, not the mod.
