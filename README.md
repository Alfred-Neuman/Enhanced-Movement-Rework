### Info

This is a rewrite of BadBenson's "Enhanced Movement."
Disables all functions in EM to solely use the animations with new lightweight scripts. The goal of the mod is to simplify the functions, expand functionality, and get rid of any issues EM had. The mod will also be open source, so any contributions are welcome.
